# Redue

A cross-platform [Due](http://www.dueapp.com/) desktop client. Written using Electron, Angular 2, and TypeScript.

## Progress

If you've got Dropbox installed to the default path on Linux (and possibly OS X), Redue can already sit there in the background and nag you when needed. So the biggest selling point of Due is covered :) Of course, what fun is a read-only client!

This list covers just the baseline requirements, and ignores finer details. For more detailed TODOs, polishing, bugs, etc., head over to the issue tracker.
